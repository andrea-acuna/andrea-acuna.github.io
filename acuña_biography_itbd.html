        <h3>My Childhood Story</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was <u>born and raised</u> in the province of <b>Isabela</b>.<sup>1</sup> I am the <b>eldest of four siblings</b>.<sup>2</sup> As the eldest, I naturally took on a responsible role, often looking after my younger siblings.<sup>3</sup> However, I am also a <b>quiet and shy girl</b>.<sup>4</sup> My favorite pastime was playing with <b>Barbie dolls</b> and creating different roleplays, imagining various stories and characters.<sup>5</sup> Like most kids, I loved running around. <sup>6</sup> As a result, I got a pretty big scar on my right knee. <sup>7</sup> I enjoyed watching shows like <b>Barbie, Winx Club, Mr. Bean, Tom & Jerry, Blue’s Clues</b>, and many more.<sup>8</sup> I also had my share of <i>embarrassing moments</i> during childhood.<sup>9</sup> One of the most unforgettable ones was when I was still in <b>Kindergarten</b>, I </i>accidentally pooped in my underwear while at school</i>.<sup>10</sup> Another funny story my <b>father</b> always reminded me of was how I used to mispronounce color <b>Blue</b>, saying <b><i>“boo”</i></b> instead.<sup>11</sup> Also, even when I was already in <b>Grade 1</b>, I still drank bottled milk and even brought it to school.<sup>12</sup> My <b>lola</b> used to have a <b><i>tindahan/carinderia</i></b> business so I would often visit because I get to have food and snacks for free.<sup>13</sup> One of the most <i>significant moments</i> of my childhood was getting my period at the young age of 9.<sup>14</sup> I had no idea what was happening or what to do.<sup>15</sup> Thankfully, my <b>mother</b> was there to guide and explain everything to me.<sup>16</sup> Life was <b>peaceful, simple and full of warmth</b> back then.<sup>17</sup> At the <b>age of 11 and in Grade 5</b>, my family and I <b>moved to Qatar</b>, a completely different place from what I was used to.<sup>18</sup> Adjusting to a new country, culture, and school system was very challenging at first.<sup>19</sup> I missed my relatives back home, but I eventually learned to <b>adapt and find comfort</b> in my new environment.<sup>20</sup></p>

        <h3>My Teenage Years</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years in <b>Qatar</b> were a time of <b>curiosity, self-discovery, and uncertainty</b>.<sup>1</sup> I start to ask questions such as about <b>who I really am, what I want to become, and what is the purpose of life</b>.<sup>2</sup> It’s also a time where I experience <i>significant life events</i>.<sup>3</sup> Like most teenagers, I did face pressures – <b>peer pressure and academic expectations</b>.<sup>4</sup> Despite this, I made sure to spend time with my <b>family and close friends</b>.<sup>5</sup> We would often hangout at malls, museums, parks, cafes, and cultural sites.<sup>6</sup> There are also beautiful beaches and desert adventures.<sup>7</sup> My family and I <i>frequently</i> moved to different apartments.<sup>8</sup> If my memory serves me right, we moved about <b>5 times</b>.<sup>9</sup> Living in Qatar exposed me to a <b>diverse mix of cultures and people</b>.<sup>10</sup> However, there are also many Filipinos in Qatar, making it easier to find a <i>sense of home</i> even in a foreign land.<sup>11</sup> No matter where I went, I would always see a <b><i>“kababayan”</i></b>.<sup>12</sup> Living in the Middle East introduced me to their <b>cuisine</b>, which I came to love and now can’t live without it.<sup>13</sup> I also experienced many <b>firsts</b>, such as <u>seeing a camel up close and going on a sand dune adventure</u>.<sup>14</sup> As high school came to an end, I had to <b>go back to the Philippines</b> to study for college.<sup>15</sup> This was both an <b>exciting and nerve-wracking change</b>, as I had lived in Qatar for <b>almost 12 years</b> and had grown attached to my life there.<sup>16</sup> Leaving behind the <b>friends and environment</b> I had known for so long was difficult, but I knew that returning to my home country was <i>necessary</i> for my future.<sup>17</sup> I left Qatar with my <b>younger sister</b>, and we both began a <b>new chapter</b> of our lives here in the Philippines.<sup>18</sup> Since our <b>parents, together with our two siblings, remained abroad</b>, we had to learn how to be <b>independent and responsible</b> for ourselves.<sup>19</sup> Despite the <i>challenges</i> of adjusting to a new environment again, I was <b>determined to embrace it</b>.<sup>20</sup></p>

      <h3>My College Experience</h3>
      <blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost 12 years in Qatar, I went back here in the Philippines to pursue higher education at <b>University of the East – Manila</b>.<sup>1</sup> I am currently a <u>3rd year (irregular) student</u> taking up <b>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</b>.<sup>2</sup> My decision to choose this course was influenced by my interest in computers and technology, as well as <i>promising</i> career opportunities in the IT field.<sup>3</sup> Adjusting to college life in Manila was not easy at first as I struggled with <i>homesickness</i>.<sup>4</sup> Now, I can say that I have adapted to the fast-paced city life.<sup>5</sup> The <b>BSIT program</b> in UE Manila introduced me to various fields, from <b>programming and networking to database management and software development</b>.<sup>6</sup> Some subjects were easy to understand because of my prior knowledge, while others pushed me to expand my <b>skills and problem-solving abilities</b>.<sup>7</sup> <b>Coding, debugging errors, assignment/projet deadlines, and late-night study sessions</b> have been part of my daily routine.<sup>8</sup> Being an irregular student was <i>challenging</i> – I often felt <i>out of place</i>, moving between different classmates and schedules <sup>9</sup> It was not easy, but I am thankful for the <b>friends</b> I met along the way.<sup>10</sup> One thing that made my college life easier is living in a <b><i>dorm</i></b>, which saves me from the stress of daily commuting.<sup>11</sup> While many students enjoyed going to parties and drinking alcohol, I was never that type of student.<sup>12</sup> I have also started to collect random trinkets or <b><i>“anik-anik”</i></b>, which I once thought was a childish hobby but now see as something <i>sentimental</i>.<sup>13</sup> Whenever there are no classes or during vacation, I always go back to our province in <b>Isabela</b> to be with our <b>grandparents</b>.<sup>14</sup> Being in the province brings me a sense of peace and <i>nostalgia</i>.<sup>15</sup> I also take the opportunity to go back to <b>Qatar</b> to visit my <b>parents and other siblings</b> and <i>reconnect</i> with my life there.<sup>16</sup> Looking back, I can see how much I have changed – from the little girl who loved to play with Barbie dolls to a college student learning to be independent.<sup>17</sup> The journey has not been easy, but every challenge and experience has shaped me into the person I am today.<sup>18</sup> Though I still have a long way to go, I am grateful for everything that has brought me to this point.<sup>19</sup> <b>I look forward to building a future in the IT field, equipped with the knowledge and experiences I have gained.</b><sup>20</sup></p>
