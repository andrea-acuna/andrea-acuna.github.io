                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in the province of Isabela.<sup>1</sup> I am the eldest of four siblings.<sup>2</sup> As the eldest, I naturally took on a responsible role, often looking after my younger siblings.<sup>3</sup> However, I am also a quiet and shy girl.<sup>4</sup> My favorite pastime was playing with Barbie dolls and creating different roleplays, imagining various stories and characters.<sup>5</sup> Like most kids, I loved running around.<sup>6</sup> As a result, I got a pretty big scar on my right knee.<sup>7</sup> I enjoyed watching shows like Barbie, Winx Club, Mr. Bean, Tom & Jerry, Blue's Clues, and many more.<sup>8</sup> I also had my share of embarrassing moments during childhood.<sup>9</sup> One of the most unforgettable ones was when I was still in Kindergarten, I accidentally pooped in my underwear while at school.<sup>10</sup> Another funny story my father always reminded me of was how I used to mispronounce color Blue, saying "boo" instead.<sup>11</sup> Also, even when I was already in Grade 1, I still drank bottled milk and even brought it to school.<sup>12</sup> My lola used to have a tindahan/carinderia business so I would often visit because I get to have food and snacks for free.<sup>13</sup> One of the most significant moments of my childhood was getting my period at the young age of 9.<sup>14</sup> I had no idea what was happening or what to do.<sup>15</sup> Thankfully, my mother was there to guide and explain everything to me.<sup>16</sup> Life was peaceful, simple, and full of warmth back then.<sup>17</sup> At the age of 11 and in Grade 5, my family and I moved to Qatar, a completely different place from what I was used to.<sup>18</sup> Adjusting to a new country, culture, and school system was very challenging at first.<sup>19</sup> I missed my relatives back home, but I eventually learned to adapt and find comfort in my new environment.<sup>20</sup></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years in Qatar were a time of curiosity, self-discovery, and uncertainty.<sup>1</sup> I start to ask questions such as about who I really am, what I want to become, and what is the purpose of life.<sup>2</sup> It's also a time where I experience significant life events.<sup>3</sup> Like most teenagers, I did face pressures – peer pressure and academic expectations.<sup>4</sup> Despite this, I made sure to spend time with my family and close friends.<sup>5</sup> We would often hang out at malls, museums, parks, cafes, and cultural sites.<sup>6</sup> There are also beautiful beaches and desert adventures.<sup>7</sup> My family and I frequently moved to different apartments.<sup>8</sup> If my memory serves me right, we moved about 5 times.<sup>9</sup> Living in Qatar exposed me to a diverse mix of cultures and people.<sup>10</sup> However, there are also many Filipinos in Qatar, making it easier to find a sense of home even in a foreign land.<sup>11</sup> No matter where I went, I would always see a kababayan.<sup>12</sup> Living in the Middle East introduced me to their cuisine, which I came to love and now can't live without it.<sup>13</sup> I also experienced many firsts, such as seeing a camel up close and going on a sand dune adventure.<sup>14</sup> As high school came to an end, I had to go back to the Philippines to study for college.<sup>15</sup> This was both an exciting and nerve-wracking change, as I had lived in Qatar for almost 12 years and had grown attached to my life there.<sup>16</sup> Leaving behind the friends and environment I had known for so long was difficult, but I knew that returning to my home country was necessary for my future.<sup>17</sup> I left Qatar with my younger sister, and we both began a new chapter of our lives here in the Philippines.<sup>18</sup> Since our parents, together with our two siblings, remained abroad, we had to learn how to be independent and responsible for ourselves.<sup>19</sup> Despite the challenges of adjusting to a new environment again, I was determined to embrace it.<sup>20</sup></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After almost 12 years in Qatar, I went back here in the Philippines to pursue higher education at University of the East – Manila.<sup>1</sup> I am currently a 3rd year (irregular) student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.<sup>2</sup> My decision to choose this course was influenced by my interest in computers and technology, as well as promising career opportunities in the IT field.<sup>3</sup> Adjusting to college life in Manila was not easy at first as I struggled with homesickness.<sup>4</sup> Now, I can say that I have adapted to the fast-paced city life.<sup>5</sup> The BSIT program in UE Manila introduced me to various fields, from programming and networking to database management and software development.<sup>6</sup> Some subjects were easy to understand because of my prior knowledge, while others pushed me to expand my skills and problem-solving abilities.<sup>7</sup> Coding, debugging errors, assignment/project deadlines, and late-night study sessions have been part of my daily routine.<sup>8</sup> Being an irregular student was challenging – I often felt out of place, moving between different classmates and schedules.<sup>9</sup> It was not easy, but I am thankful for the friends I met along the way.<sup>10</sup> One thing that made my college life easier is living in a dorm, which saves me from the stress of daily commuting.<sup>11</sup> While many students enjoyed going to parties and drinking alcohol, I was never that type of student.<sup>12</sup> I have also started to collect random trinkets or anik-anik, which I once thought was a childish hobby but now see as something sentimental.<sup>13</sup> Whenever there are no classes or during vacation, I always go back to our province in Isabela to be with our grandparents.<sup>14</sup> Being in the province brings me a sense of peace and nostalgia.<sup>15</sup> I also take the opportunity to go back to Qatar to visit my parents and other siblings and reconnect with my life there.<sup>16</sup> Looking back, I can see how much I have changed – from the little girl who loved to play with Barbie dolls to a college student learning to be independent.<sup>17</sup> The journey has not been easy, but every challenge and experience has shaped me into the person I am today.<sup>18</sup> Though I still have a long way to go, I am grateful for everything that has brought me to this point.<sup>19</sup> I look forward to building a future in the IT field, equipped with the knowledge and experiences I have gained.<sup>20</sup></p>
