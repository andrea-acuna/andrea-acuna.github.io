                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hobbies are what make life more enjoyable because they allow us to do things we love outside of our responsibilities.<sup>1</sup> One of my favorite hobbies is playing and watching Volleyball.<sup>2</sup> Playing Volleyball helps me to stay active, while watching Volleyball games allows me to support my favorite players and enjoy the excitement of the game.<sup>3</sup> Watching Korean shows on Netflix is another hobby I enjoy.<sup>4</sup> The storylines, characters and cinematography keep me engaged, and at the same time, I get to learn more about Korean culture and language.<sup>5</sup> I also enjoy collecting "anik-anik," which are small, cute, and unique items that make me happy.<sup>6</sup> Some of them hold special memories, while others simply bring me joy because of their designs.<sup>7</sup> Playing games, both board and mobile, is another way I like to spend my free time.<sup>8</sup> Board games are fun when played with friends and family, while mobile games keep me entertained when I'm alone.<sup>9</sup> Photoshop and video editing are also hobbies I enjoy because they allow me to express my creativity.<sup>10</sup> I love creating designs, editing clips, and making something artistic.<sup>11</sup> Learning to cook has also become a hobby of mine.<sup>12</sup> Trying out new recipes, experimenting with flavors, and seeing the results of my cooking make me feel accomplished.<sup>13</sup> Traveling is something I really enjoy, as it allows me to see new places, experience different cultures, and create lasting memories.<sup>14</sup> Music is also a big part of my life.<sup>15</sup> Whether I am studying, relaxing, or traveling, I always have music playing in the background.<sup>16</sup> Music helps me focus, lifts my mood, and makes every moment feel better.<sup>17</sup> I like scrolling through social media as well, especially to discover new trends, watch interesting content, or just stay updated with what's happening.<sup>18</sup> Online shopping has also become something I enjoy, not just for the thrill of buying something new but also because I like searching for the best deals and comparing products.<sup>19</sup> No matter how busy life gets, I always try to make time for my hobbies because they keep me happy, motivated, and balanced.<sup>20</sup></p>
